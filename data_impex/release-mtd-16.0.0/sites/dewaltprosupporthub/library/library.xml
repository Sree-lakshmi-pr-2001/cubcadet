&lt;!--- Section 1 ---&gt;&#13;
	&lt;h2&gt;I. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		DeWalt has partnered with MTD Products Inc to make the Pro Support Hub available to consumers.  Through the Pro Support Hub and the related software application, MTD, its affiliates and partners (collectively “MTD” or “we”), may collect and store Personal Information regarding customers, employees and associates, suppliers, and distributors.  Personal Information may be collected, transferred, and stored on servers located in any country in which we do business.&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		MTD is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Personal Information collected as part of their normal business activities. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) only applies to the Personal Information that is provided through the Pro Support Hub application in any form or medium, and may be amended from time to time. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes here as notification and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back to our website periodically.&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&#13;
&lt;!--- Section 2 ---&gt;&#13;

&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;

Personal Information does not include information that is publicly available, such as a person's name, address and phone number listed in a directory.&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		Personal Information that we collect includes: &#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
		&lt;div class="conditions-block-list"&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;

			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(iv) Information about your shopping preferences, purchases, and purchase orders;&#13;
			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(v) Survey and demographic information, such as your age, household information, lawn care/outdoor power product ownership/purchase history, employment information (i.e. job title, location, etc.), and your product preferences;&#13;

&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		We may collect your Personal Information for various purposes:&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
		&lt;div class="conditions-block-list"&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(i) We collect contact information and product information for legal and commercial reasons, so we may fulfill requests for products, administer product programs and warranties, respond to customer service inquiries, answer questions about our offerings, and communicate with customers.&#13;
			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(ii) We maintain records of your contacts with our customer service centers for training and quality control purposes.&#13;
			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(iii) We also collect contact information and product information to enable us to provide customers with notice of any product advisories or safety notices and as necessary to respond to legal and/or regulatory inquiries.&#13;
			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(iv) We collect information regarding shopping preferences, survey and demographic information for marketing, advertising and product development purposes.  This information enables MTD to learn about our customers, to develop products that meet their needs and preferences, to create and administer product programs that are of interest to our customers.&#13;
			&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
			&lt;p&gt;&#13;
				(v) For those who provide Personal Information in the context of their employment with us or as part of an application for employment, Personal Information will be used for employment purposes (i.e. keeping updated organizational information, making hiring and employment related decisions, employee training, employment investigations, etc.). &#13;

		&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
	&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;

	&#13;
	&#13;

You also authorize MTD to include marketing content in any such messages. You do not have to Opt-In or agree to Opt-In as a condition of purchase.&#13;

		MTD may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting. If you are enrolled in Text Services, MTD will send a text message to note that the Terms have been amended.

&lt;!--- Item 8 ---&gt;&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		&amp;emsp;8. &lt;span class="underlined"&gt;Disputes.&lt;/span&gt;&#13;
		&lt;strong&gt;&#13;
			Please read this “Disputes” section carefully. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY. ALTHOUGH REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT AND MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of these Terms and Conditions.&#13;
		&lt;/strong&gt;&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		&amp;emsp;a. &lt;i&gt;Binding Arbitration.&lt;/i&gt; &#13;
		This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, your participation in the Text Service, or your relationship with MTD. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, your access to or participation in the Text Service, or your relationship with MTDor any subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either party may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.		&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		&amp;emsp;b. &lt;i&gt;Arbitration Procedures.&lt;/i&gt; &#13;
		For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of your claim to MTD’s Customer Service department to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and MTD each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days.  The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by these Term. The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at &lt;span class="green-text"&gt;www.adr.org&lt;/span&gt;. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor MTD may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		&amp;emsp;c. &lt;i&gt;Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver.&lt;/i&gt; &#13;
		You and MTD each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and MTD that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.&#13;
	&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
	&lt;p&gt;&#13;
		&amp;emsp;d. &lt;i&gt;Governing Law.&lt;/i&gt; &#13;
		Any dispute arising from these Terms or your access to or participation in the Text Service will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Ohio, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Medina County, Ohio.&#13;
